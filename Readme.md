### Kevin's Kombining Kalculator, or KKK for short ###
~remember to say "I love the KKK" when you're done using this program~

Version 1.0, not that it'll ever change lmao

When using this program, ONLY CHANGE ITEMS IN GlobalVariables.py. Variables are explained in that file
To run the program in pycharm, press the green arrow in the upper right corner of the screen on the RunMe.py file
The output will include a list of appended files (to check) and will spit out the file. Remember to include your file name
    when imputting the output. Also remember that this program will append ALL files of that extension - best to put only
    the files your care about into their separate directory.
